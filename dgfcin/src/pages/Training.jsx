            In DGFC, we have a MOTO “SAFETY FIRST.” Hence, we focus on the regular training of our
            Drivers, supervisors & staff to update them with all safety measures to be followed and
            motivate them with different slides, mock drills, road shows, and videos. We are having
            our own training centers in our Hub office Dharuhera and also in our Mumbai office.
            We also keep a regular watch on the health and fitness of our drivers by conducting
            regular monitoring of the health checkup reports such as health checkup and eye checkup
            by conducting checkup camps and also getting the checkups done in regular intervals from
            reputed medical institutions.
